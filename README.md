# ldp-service

A simple Node.js module providing Express middleware to create a [W3C Linked Data Platform](http://www.w3.org/2012/ldp) server. The service uses MongoDB for persistence, jsonld.js for JSON-LD support, and a few other JavaScript libraries.  A sample app using the LDP middleware service is running at [http://ldp-app.mybluemix.net](http://ldp-app.mybluemix.net).

ldp-service supports LDP basic and direct containers. Indirect
containers and non-RDF source are not implemented.

Many thanks to Steve Speicher and Sam Padgett for their valuable contribution to LDP and this LDP middleware.

Module planning, maintenance and issues can be see at at the [ldp-service](https://hub.jazz.net/project/jamsden/ldp-service/overview) IBM Bluemix DevOps Services project.


## Using

1) Install the required modules

Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). 

Install and start [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/installation/).

Install express.js and create a sample express app

	$ npm install express -g
	$ express --git -e <appDir>

2) Edit the package.json file to add a dependency on ldp-service

	"dependencies": {"ldp-service": "~0.0.1"},

3) Edit app.js and add whatever Express middleware you need including ldp-service. ldp-service also provides access to its MongoDB database in case additional middleware needs direct access to the database.

	var ldpService = require('ldp-service');
	app.use(ldpService());
	var db = ldpService.db; // incase further middleware needs access to the database

4) Configuration defaults can be found in config.json. These may be overridden by variables in the environment, including Bluemix variables if deployed in a Bluemix app.

5) To start the app, run these commands

    $ npm install
    $ node app.js
